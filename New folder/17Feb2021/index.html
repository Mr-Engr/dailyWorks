<h3> <b>Story 1:</b> The Swan and the Owl</h3>

<div class='container'>
  <p>  Once upon a time, there lived a Swan near a lake in a forest.</p>

  <p>  One night, an Owl saw the Swan gliding on the lake in the moonlight. He praised the Swan and soon, the two became friends. They met near the lake for many days.</p>
    
    <p>  The Owl soon got bored of the place and told the Swan, “I am going back to my forest. You are welcome to visit me whenever you want to.”</p>
    
    <p>  One day, the Swan decided to visit the Owl. It
    
    was daylight when the Swan reached the Owl’s home. She could not find him, as he was hiding in the dark hole of a tree.</p>
    
    <p>  The Owl told the Swan, “Please rest till the sun sets. I can come out only at night.” </p>
